Craftable Spawners and Spawn Eggs

Be able to craft spawners and spawn eggs.

How to make a spawner.

Throw 6 iron bars, 2 obsidian, and a Totem of Undying onto the ground. If you need to find any recipes, go into the files and look at the recipes.


How to install.

Download the file.

Open the downloads folder

Then, navigate to the appdata folder (go to your user/appdata or do Win key + R and type %appdata%) in a new window

Open the ".minecraft" folder

Find and open saves and choose the world you want the datapack to be in and open "datapacks"

In the downloads folder, extract the file and move it to the datapacks folder

In Minecraft, type /reload and have fun

Note:
This project is NOT finished. I am working to add more spawn eggs in the future. If there are any issues or spawn eggs you want added, comment it.
